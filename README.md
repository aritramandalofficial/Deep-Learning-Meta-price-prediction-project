# Meta Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project aims to predict Meta's stock price for the next year using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series forecasting. The model is trained on four years of historical stock price data, focusing specifically on the last 50 days of closing price data to make accurate predictions for the future.
